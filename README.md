# Hi, I’m @GeniusPilot2016 👋

I build 3D props for Minecraft mods, make music, and write code. I enjoy blending visual creativity with interactive experiences — whether that’s modeling an in-game asset or composing a tune.

## About me
- Pronouns: She/Her
- Interests: 3D modeling for Minecraft mods, music, programming
- Currently learning / focusing on: C# (primary focus on interactive apps development)

## What I work on
- 3D models and props for Minecraft and modding communities
- Small C# apps prototypes, especially AI-enabled ones
- Music compositions and experiments (including fun hardware sound projects)

## Skills & tools
- 3D modeling (Blender and related meshing workflows — happy to share my pipeline)
- C# (primary)
- Music composition / piano
- Curious about low-level / retro sound (motherboard beeper experiments 🎶)

## Collaboration
I’m open to:
- 3D model collaborations for Minecraft mods
- Teaming up on small C# game or app projects
- Musical collaborations or audio-related experiments

If you have a project or idea, tell me what you’re building, what you need, and any visuals or references. I’ll share what I can contribute and how we can get started.

## Fun fact
I can play piano — and I like making tunes using the motherboard beeper (system speaker) for a retro feel 🖥️🎹

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to say hi or open an issue/PR if you want to collaborate!
